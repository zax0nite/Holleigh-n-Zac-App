I hope this doesn\u2019t sound crazy, but it really feels like the Lord has been giving me signs to shoot my shot. I\u2019ve been praying for months for the Lord find me a woman, and I was initially wanting to talk to you to see if we could be friends, but as I got to know you, you seem to be exactly what I\u2019d imagine when I would pray. I wanted to ask you over text so you could take some time to respond :) Anyways if you want to stay friends, I\u2019ll still watch Chosen and game with you but I just felt the need to say this haha, I hope I\u2019m different than the guys always hitting you up in the DMs.",

Praise the Lord! :D I hope today has been well for you also and you\u2019ve gotten through your assignments!! That does not sound crazy at all, I really appreciate you taking the time to think and ask God and have patience to ask this! I know it\u2019s so scary to communicate that and I\u2019m so proud of you :) I would 100% date you! \ud83d\ude01 I\u2019ve actually been praying and sitting on this for a while and talking to God about it for a while, and this just made my year!! \ud83d\ude01 I would of course want to meet you in person aswell ! But yes, I\u2019d date you ! :D I\u2019m literally sitting here smiling my face off \ud83d\ude02 from the time I\u2019ve gotten to know you Zac you are such an awesome and amazing person, I\u2019m truly thankful God placed you in my life when he did and I\u2019m so glad I said yes to talking to you when you reached out again in January!!  You are 100% different than the creeps DM\u2019ing me \ud83d\ude06 gah this has made my day",

I love your laugh and your whole personality, I love getting to FaceTime you because I get to see you and it makes my whole entire year. You completely take over my thoughts all the time, I find myself constantly thinking about you. I find myself sometimes just staring and admiring you which I hope doesn\u2019t sound creepy \ud83d\ude06 but how can I not admire Gods beautiful creation. Zac you are truly one of the best people I\u2019ve had the honor of meeting. I talk to myself in my head all the time about how cute and handsome you are, I internally freak out when you send me a snap or we do get to talk face to face and I\u2019m trying to be discreet\ud83d\ude02 but yeah, I think you\u2019re really great :) I love everything about you, flaws and all. Our flaws don\u2019t define us, you are such a strong and amazing person and I\u2019m truly honored you\u2019ve chosen me to want to do life with and walk alongside . I thank God everyday for you, I talk to God about you every single day because I just can\u2019t believe you took interest in me and want me. I still have some baggage I need to flesh out and something to tell you because I am serious about this, about us. I\u2019m all in, I was all in from the day you confessed and I\u2019ve been in since before then haha. I know we can and will make this work out, no matter the distance or times zones or whatever.

            "text": "Hey! This might be a long message or it might not be, we shall see by how much I ramble and type \ud83d\ude06 Zac, from the time I met you to the time we\u2019ve been able to spend together over the phone it has been truly wonderful. You have shown me since the very beginning your true personality and your true self, I admire that. I know in today\u2019s day and age it\u2019s so hard to be your true authentic self, especially when the world around you tries to mold and shape you into who THEY want you to be. You\u2019ve been your true authentic self through it all, since the first time we talked way back last year of June, to this January when you first reached out and even took that risk to talk to me. Going into 2024, I never thought that I would find someone like you. I had been by myself and single for nearly 2 years and I was as contempt as I could be. I\u2019ve been told this saying that I believe to this day, \u201clove will find you when you least expect it\u201d and I truthfully and wholeheartedly believe that. Love will find you when you\u2019re not looking. Through these past few months getting to talk with you, get to know you better and just to hangout with you it has truly been a blessing. You are such a God fearing man, your passions shine through you when you talk about them. I admire your strength, your joy, your compassion and your humor you carry with you daily. I know we haven\u2019t met in person, but from the glimpses I\u2019ve been able to have from talking with you, you are truly a remarkable and God fearing man. You push me closer to the Lord, and help strengthen my relationship with God. That\u2019s rare and special. Your fruits of the spirit peak through and I\u2019ve seen them since the beginning. Little things that I noticed. The choice to trust and to choose me, someone who is across the country in a different state. That truly is a scary thing to do, but with you it feels so natural. You squashed any worries I had when we talked the other day, and I haven\u2019t second guessed my decision to be committed to you since your confession ast month! Growing up love was never showed to me in a healthy way in my household. My parents relationship is strained and it\u2019s never been a relationship showing Gods love he wants for spouses. So I\u2019ve had a flawed view of it growing up. But, my bestfriends family has shown me what love looks like. Through my last relationship, we immediately said those 3 big words on day 1, so I never knew what it was like because my 14 year old brain said it from the beginning. I\u2019ve slowly realized that love comes in different ways, in friendships, the daily tasks we do everyday, Gods love for us seen in everyday life. With all my rambling, this does have a point I promise. Zac you show love and care in the sweetest ways, when I first played minecraft with you, you grabbed flowers from a trip somewhere and it made my heart soar. Your subtle hints and comments when we\u2019d call and just all these little things meant a ton to me, it showed me a different way of care. You show it in remembering the small things about me, you show it in the most subtle but noticeable ways. I might sound crazy, who knows, we haven\u2019t met in person, and I\u2019m terrified out of my mind but I\u2019m trusting God in this through it all. You have taken over my every thought, you plague my thoughts every single day 24/7. The smallest of things reminds me of you, the sunsets I see at Auburn, the sky, so many other things I could ramble on for forever. You captivate my every thought every single day,. Your smile, your laugh, the sound of your voice, the way you smile when you talk about something your passionate about. I love your beautiful smile, it lights up any room and it always makes my day when I get to see it your breathtaking eyes, my favorite color. Your eyes blue like the sea, as the blue winter sky and the ocean in the spring. Flawless just like the sky, they are the most beautiful shade and it made me fall in love with the color even more. I could ramble on for hours- days even, probably months about everything I adore about you. To say all of this, I am scared to write this out. I\u2019ve been thinking on this and making sure that this was right before I typed it out or brought this to you- because no matter what I\u2019m not perfect, but I want you to know that I will stay committed to you for the rest of my life. I feel like you are truly an answered prayer, and I\u2019d do it all over again if it means I get to meet you and go through this adventure with you :) anyways- I\u2019ve sat on this for a bit, because I wanted to get everything in check before coming to you about it. I\u2019m in love with you, all the signs are there for me and I can\u2019t deny it any longer. God has been nudging me and giving me so many obvious signs. You consume my every thought, just seeing your message pop up on my phone sends a smile to my face, getting to hear your voice and just talk with you or just hang out on call is the highlight of my week. I have something written down in my notes, and it\u2019s called \u201cwhat\u2019s a soulmate\u201d and it describes a beautiful description, saying how it\u2019s like a bestfriend but more. The one person who knows you better than anyone, who makes you a better person. You inspire me to be a better person. Someone who knew you, accepted you and believed in you before anyone else did or when no one would. You\u2019ve taken me all, in my flaws and everything you\u2019ve still pursued me and reassured me through everything. Writing this out stressed me to the max- I was actually writing this out before you called me a bit ago haha \ud83d\ude06 But yeah, I love you Zac :) man. That\u2019s wild to say. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s crazy of me to say that because again, never met you and we\u2019ve only been talking for a few months, but you\u2019re different. You make my heart beat out of my chest and you give me butterflies and make me feel seen, heard and valued. I thank God for you every single day. There hasn\u2019t been a day I\u2019ve second guessed this decision. There is still something I do need to tell you moving forward in this relationship that we are building, but I did want to get this out there :) \ud83e\ude75\ud83e\ude75\ud83e\ude75 \"Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor: If either of them falls down, one can help the other up. But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up. Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm. But how can one keep warm alone? Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken.\" ~ Ecclesiastes 4:9-12",

            "text": "Holleigh, after all my previous relationship endeavors, I can surely say that talking to you have been an entirely different experience than what I have been used to. Being in a relationship to me has always been so shallow. I\u2019ve always been stressed pretending to be someone I wasn\u2019t, I said things like \u201cI love you\u201d just cause I thought that was what you were supposed to do. Every time the Bible talked about love, it just seemed so foreign to me because of my experiences.  I\u2019ve tried to hide my interests just to appease the person I\u2019d talk to, and they would always be attracted to me on the surface, such as just my body or the fact that I play hockey. For the first time I can say I\u2019ve built this relationship on being myself, approaching you under my twitter account, my most repressed interest. I\u2019m serious when I say this, if I didn\u2019t talk to you, I would still be lost, pretending to be someone I\u2019m not.   From talking to you, I can really say that I love you and mean it. It\u2019s funny, from the start I\u2019ve had a naive sense of trust when talking to you. Now I know it isn\u2019t naive, you are genuinely trustworthy, we\u2019ve connected on such a deep level that I can\u2019t imagine talking to anyone else, and I feel like you feel the same way. It\u2019s ironic that this we are so far from each other, but this is the most genuine relationship I\u2019ve had by far. I\u2019ve felt God nudging me towards you in so many obvious ways as well, and I can see why. You have also strengthened my faith deeply, I\u2019ve had such an easier time following the word of God ever since meeting you. You remind me of the entirety of Proverbs 31, especially the value of a God fearing woman in verse 30, \u201cFavour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.\u201d The best part is, I don\u2019t have to worry about the beauty is vain part because you are beautiful :) Every time I see you smile, it\u2019s so special to me. When you smile, your personality shines through it like nobody else. I\u2019m blessed to be able to experience that personality every time I talk to you \ud83e\ude75 From your instagram posts to even looking at you on FaceTime, I can\u2019t stop smiling thinking about how pretty you are. I can\u2019t look at any other woman the same after meeting you, and I don\u2019t want to share my life with anyone else. I\u2019m terribly sorry your parents haven\u2019t been the perfect example of a relationship, but relieved to hear about your friend\u2019s family. I\u2019m happy to make the sacrifices to make sure our relationship is as healthy as it can be, and I\u2019m ready to learn on the way, growing with every mistake. I know neither of us are perfect, but I know we can help each other in our flaws. I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve developed such a deep connection without ever seeing each other in person, I want to ensure you that I\u2019m the same in person as I am online :) I\u2019ve never felt more happy reading a message, thank you so much for spending the time writing it. I\u2019ve got to get to sleep now, and I hope you have an excellent start to your Monday \ud83e\udde1",

Let\u2019s make today great!!! \ud83d\ude04 I was not expecting this when I woke up\ud83e\udd79 this is such a sweet and heartfelt message, and I am grinning like crazy re-reading it over and over to make sure I\u2019m not dreaming or hallucinating. I talked to you because of WHO you are, not what you do or what you look like, even though those are +\u2019s \ud83d\ude09 There\u2019s a verse I\u2019ve kept close to me when going into this, 1 Samual 16:7 \u201cDo not look at his appearance or at the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For the LORD sees not as man sees; for man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart.\u201d I don\u2019t look for looks, job, wealth etc.. those are all earthly things that will fade, but your heart and personality will stay no matter what! Matthew 6:21 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. Your heart shows your personality and who you are the most. I\u2019ve grown up thinking I had to look a certain way, have this have that etc.. when in reality, it\u2019s not what I look like or have, it\u2019s my heart. Your heart is so precious Zac, from every encounter I\u2019ve had with you, you\u2019ve shown compassion, humility, thoughtfulness, care, joy, and so so much more. I\u2019m so glad you decided to message me on Twitter, who knew that single message would lead to this great adventure :) you don\u2019t have to pretend around me, I can promise you I won\u2019t ever judge you. No matter what mistakes people make, I always show love, we aren\u2019t defined by our mistakes. I\u2019ve also had a naive sense of trust with you, I\u2019ve become more trustworthy in life but with you it\u2019s been different, you\u2019re different! Especially from my baggage that I carry, it\u2019s been so easy to talk to you and trust you. Haha I know right!! I don\u2019t think distance matters when God is involved, no matter the distance, if it\u2019s Gods will it\u2019ll happen. I\u2019ve seen His hand throughout these past few months, and that\u2019s not by mistake! \ud83e\udd79 this is so precious. I\u2019ve dreamed and strived to be a Proverbs 31 woman \ud83d\ude06 it\u2019s been pushed so much on women that it\u2019s kinda been on the back of my mind to be a certain way etc\u2026 but with you I don\u2019t have to act different or to impress, I can just be myself :) thank youuuu\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70 Gah this makes my heart soar\ud83e\udd79 I\u2019ve never heard this before and I\u2019m gonna tear up haha\ud83d\udc99 Yeah, my parents relationship has always been rough, but I\u2019m glad God placed my friend in my life so I could learn what biblical love is on the side. In a way it made me question it and I had the opportunity to dive in and learn more about it, and I\u2019ve learned so much. I actually know so much, I have books on relationships and I\u2019ve even done papers on the topic in highschool. I also act as a relationship counselor to my friends haha, God has given me an interest and love for it,, and just realizing that someone feels the same way makes me so so happy. I know I was destined to have a partner some day and God has been blessing me these past few weeks and I just can\u2019t believe it. Zac you truly are one of my greatest blessings to come out of 2024\ud83e\ude75 I\u2019m ready to grow alongside you in our journey, no matter where it takes us :) I\u2019m really glad we\u2019ve developed the connection while never met, I think it holds a deeper foundation for us, some people rely on seeing their bf/gf daily and having that physical connection, but the strongest foundation is on the Lord. I can also ensure that I\u2019m the same person I portray online aswell, I\u2019m always my true authentic self no matter where I\u2019m at or if it\u2019s on social media :) Thank you for spending the time to write this out\ud83e\ude75 it made me smile getting to read though this :)) I hope you got enough rest and you\u2019re ready to take on another day!!

I\u2019m excited to treat you right, unlike you\u2019ve been treated in your previous relationship. I\u2019d never thought I\u2019d find someone like you, you are truly one of a kind and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you. What a beautiful piece you\u2019ve drawn, and the song is so perfect for it. I see us in that piece, but I also see the Lord. He worked in you to draw it, and he will work in us to build a Godly relationship. I\u2019m committed long term, and honestly work has been a drag lately and it was hard finding motivation to work hard, but with you in my life, I\u2019ve got more motivation now than ever. I can\u2019t wait to hug you in person \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99 and I want to work hard so that distance doesn\u2019t have to be a factor and I can hug ya everyday :)",

Praise the Lord it\u2019s the weekend!!\ud83d\ude01 I just want to express how thankful I am for you Zac\ud83e\ude75 I was never expecting to find someone as gracious and loving and caring as you, but the Lord had other plans. I stumbled across this Bible verse the other day, and it immediately reminded me of you\ud83d\udc99 \u201cHusbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her\u00a0to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no one ever hated their own body, but they feed and care for their body, just as Christ does the church\u2014 for we are members of his body. \u201cFor this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.\u201d Ephesians 5:25-31 From the day I first met you up until now, you have shown the fruits of the spirit, loving, caring, humbling. Since stepping into this friendship that blossomed into something beautiful, you have always shown Gods love and His care towards me. You have had patience with me and shown me humility and humbleness throughout it all. I\u2019m truly honored God decided to bring you into my life Zac!\ud83e\ude75 you have changed it for the better, I couldn\u2019t imagine my life without you now! I\u2019m really excited to see where God takes us heading forward\ud83d\udc99 I\u2019m so thankful for you, I\u2019m so in love with you. All of you. I love your smile, it lights up any room, and it always brightens up my day no matter what, I love the sound of your voice, I love your laugh. I love your personality, it radiates joy and Christs\u2019 love and His joy! I cannot wait to see you in 25 days\ud83e\udd70",

I really adore this, it explains 1 Corinthians 13:4-8 and it embodies the most truest form of love,, love never fails. I saw a quote that said \u201cthe Bible says love never fails, so if it fails it wasn\u2019t love\u201d and it made me reflect on what love is and what it means. I have a ton of Devo\u2019s on love and books about the subject. I was obsessed with it in Highschool cause I guess I never received it correctly,, but I\u2019ve learned slowly overtime what true love is from the Bible and from friends etc\u2026 as soon as I heard this from their album it immediately became a favorite. This song embodies everything I feel for you- no matter what I\u2019m here and I\u2019ll love you through the seasons, no matter what we go through. \ud83e\ude75",

Ever since that phone call in January, my life changed forever, for the better. These past few months have been nothing but blessed. Getting to know you and build this relationship has been wonderful, and nothing like I could have ever imagined. Some days I wake up wondering how I got so lucky to call you mine? How in the world out of everyone on this planet that you chose me. I find myself pondering how I got this lucky to have someone as wonderful and caring, loving and so kind in my life- how did I deserve to have you placed into my life? You are an answered prayer Zac.

I choose to love you \ud83d\ude18 Song of Solomon 8:6-7 (KJV): \u201cSet me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame. Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.\u201d",

I thank God for you every waking moment, not able to comprehend that He gave me you. Distance isn\u2019t forever, I have faith in Gods plan. We were brought together for a reason. Even though it\u2019s tough and it hurts sometimes, it\u2019s all going to be worth it in the long run. The distance is temporary, a love like this is rare. I\u2019d spend the rest of my life in long distance if it meant one day I\u2019d get to be by your side. I promise to stay by your side through it all. The ups, the downs, good, bad. No matter what life throws at us. I am committed to you 110%. I see my future with you by my side, only you as my partner and soulmate. I\u2019m yours, only yours \ud83e\ude75 I hope you have a wonderful day today, I pray you slept well and you have a great service this morning and a wonderful picnic with your family this afternoon !! I love you so much\ud83d\udc99",

You never cease to amaze me my love, the fact that you found time to draw this delightful piece while at Myrtle Beach made yell in surprise when I opened my phone in the car. The daisies all over such a heavenly scene. The lighting on our sonas bodies and hair. The flowers I wish I could pick for you in my sona\u2019s maw. The rolling hills and their content expressions, I\u2019m sure they feel at home. Thanks for the songs to listen to on the ride back too, I had a smile plastered on my face. Holleigh thinking back on this year, it feels so it\u2019s been so much longer than it has. We\u2019ve grown so close together at an incredible pace, I\u2019m so proud of us, we\u2019ve gotten through some difficult conversation and came out even closer due to it. I have an unwavering trust and respect for you, I will never back down from a difficult conversation, we\u2019ve shown to flourish past anything like that. You\u2019ve taught me how to love, I didn\u2019t think it would come so fast, but I\u2019m ready to go where it takes me. I\u2019m ready to marry you, I promise. I know it will happen. I big part of my anxiety getting into relationships was that my partner would desert me when times get hard, it was hard to put myself in someone else\u2019s hands so that they could have the power to throw me away. With you I see my whole life, your perseverance shines bright and it encourages me. I know you\u2019d never leave me, and I will never leave you. God has given me the most precious woman I can ask for and now I get to enjoy life with her, how unbelievable is that? I cannot wait to put a ring on your finger. I love you endlessly and I\u2019m thankful for you more than I could ever say. God\u2019s response to my prayers last year has never been clearer. You\u2019re the answer my wife \ud83c\udf39",

Zac you truly are someone so special and precious to me. Your smile makes my entire day, to hear you talk about your passions and your ideas is so amazing, your Ghostern story is beautifully written. You have so many amazing ideas and I know you\u2019re going to do great things!!! Zac I love you with all that I have, I promise to stay by your side till the end. You\u2019re the one I want and choose to do life beside. God put you in my life for a reason, at the most perfect time. Looking back, I can\u2019t imagine my life without you now\ud83e\ude75 I love you I love you, I love you SO much\ud83d\udc99 till death do us part",

Four months of waking up to some of the most thoughtful and loving messages I\u2019ve ever gotten. Four months of FNAF, MatPat, and our giggles in the night. Four months with not enough hugging and kissing than desired, but enough to last me a lifetime of waiting for the next time. Four months since stepping into a forever relationship with my Proverbs 31 woman, precious as rubies, even more so\u2026 I\u2019ll marry you, as a life without you would be like missing the train to my dreams becoming a reality. Here\u2019s to the rest of our lives. Lives with perfect communication necessary to navigate the bumps in the road. Lives with faith that can move those bumps, no matter how big the mountain. Lives filled with facing and overcoming problems. Lives filled with love, not the kind you fall into, but the kind you cherish and kindle so that you look back upon it and are proud. Lives of bringing life into this world, nourishing and caring for God\u2019s greatest gift. God\u2019s got a life of surprises lined up for us, let\u2019s accept each one with open arms. I love you my love, I adore you and I\u2019ll remind you more than the stars in the sky. I\u2019ll kiss you more than the grains of sand. I\u2019ll hug you until every hint of stress, sadness, and anger leaves your body. My one and only, forever and always. Happy four months \ud83d\udc99\ud83e\udde1\u2764\ufe0f",

I want to be the one to mend you when God sends you to parts and service to be rebuilt after the worst. I want to spend my nights recharging you so you can go out there and keep your joyous attitude and change lives, bring others to the Lord. It means the world to me that you\u2019d even consider being vulnerable with me because it shows the ultimate act of trust. Trust that I will support your weak points rather than take advantage of them. On days when that beautiful smile fades and it becomes hard to stay joyous, you don\u2019t have to pretend to smile. No need to drain your battery further, I won\u2019t run away if you aren\u2019t your smiley, positive self all the time. On the worst days I will be around for you to just lay in my arms, no words needing to be said. Romance movies don\u2019t show it, but behind the romance are days of recharging scattered amongst days of hard work. There will be busy times in life and I\u2019ll enjoy those knowing that patience will bring times of tranquility. I feel like this is almost God\u2019s test for us, can we make it through the tough times without even being about to hug each other? I know we can, with someone as strong as you by my side, it will be more than possible. God is here too, I\u2019m always reminded of Ecclesiastes 4:12 (KJV):\u201cAnd if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.\u201d That\u2019s us babe, us and God.

We are the stars in the night sky, aligned perfectly from the culmination of our pasts until now, I could not be more pleased to be in your company. That picture of you is beautiful, not just because my beautiful wife is in there \ud83d\ude43 but the backdrop you made is an extension of yourself. It\u2019s poetic in a sense, I look at your stance and at the colors you\u2019ve painted, and I see those colors in you. The bright orange is the first ray of sunshine that finds its way through the stormy clouds, your positivity finding its way amongst the dark sky. The blue is the vast expanse of the sky, while I\u2019m in love with the color in itself, the sky is what fills the empty space amongst the clouds. You fill other people up when they are missing something in their lives, and I\u2019m certain that\u2019s God working through you. The pink and yellow remind me of the feeling I get being around you, and I know others do too. Pink is the love I feel when you do any little thing for me, yellow is the joy that fills me when you even just smile, the flower blooming within me tended and cared for by you. To see my love standing among the backdrop that she created, I see the mascot to a sorority of wonderful women. I\u2019m so incredibly proud of you so far. I\u2019ve said it before that you are enough, but you are more than enough dear, you are what I\u2019ve been praying for, and I\u2019ll marry you. Now I do want to mention that in days of distress and turmoil, that I will promise you to be there for you the most. After everything I\u2019ve just said about you, it\u2019s okay need to recharge on a bad day. You don\u2019t have to be like this 100% of the time around me, I\u2019ll be there to hold you tight in my arms and not let go until you are ready to spread your joy around the world again. There will come a day where you or I will need just that to recuperate, it\u2019s harder since I\u2019m across the country, but God\u2019s got us. I love you and I\u2019m here for you through it all.

I don\u2019t know if they are telling the truth or if they misunderstand what the phase is, but it does make me sad thinking about if or when ours will end. I just wanted to say that right now I\u2019m infatuated with you, to call and see your face has me on cloud nine every time. Hearing your voice and seeing that friendly smile is a joy I\u2019ll never get tired of. I feel like I\u2019m sailing away on a boat with you, and no matter how rough the waves are, I know I will always be at home by your side. Yeah maybe that obsession will end one day, and I\u2019ll finally be able to do anything without thinking about you the whole time. But I wanted to type this out to promise you to keep on putting effort to make you feel those butterflies and warm feelings as much as I can, forever. I promise to send texts like these, but when we live together, they will probably be in the form of letters to you my love. I promise to spoil you with thoughtful gifts like gift art and plushies, in the future this might look like surprise trips to places of your dreams too. I promise to always tell you how proud of you I am, to support you on your worst days, to tell you how you are the woman of my prayers and dreams. This won\u2019t change, but you\u2019ll be able to rest in my arms when I say these things in the future. I promise to spoil you with little acts of service, i haven\u2019t been able to do that too much because we are so far away from each other, but i look forward to it! And of course our quality time will never leave. I promise to be present with you and enjoy our time together, and I will ALWAYS ask you about your day and never get sick or tired of hearing you tap about it. You are my favorite person, and any time spent with you is a wish come true. I promise to always make an effort to hug, kiss, hold your hand, just giving you all the physical touch you could ever want. Right now I don\u2019t know how I would ever get sick of it haha, but I promise to put an effort into anything to make you smile. Most importantly, I promise to put God and His will for us in the forefront of everything, forever and ever. I don\u2019t know what came over me to type all that, maybe it\u2019s me missing you, maybe it\u2019s reassurance that you never stop feeling the sweet feelings that come with the honeymoon phase, but I know for sure it\u2019s what the person who I will love and cherish forever deserves.

As long as God comes first & spouses second, God will bless the marriage & love! Reading this genuinely brought tears to my eyes. I\u2019ve re-read this message, your declaration of your love, your promises to continue on even if that does fade. It\u2019s so astonishing and truly so heartfelt. I never imagined a love like this, you love me so intentionally, you put your heart and soul in everything you do, say and act for me; for us. This has truly made the biggest smile come on my face, and my heart grows even more in love with you, which I don\u2019t know was possible. Zac, you have shown 1 Corinthians 13:4-8 love continuously. When I replace the word love with your name, you are in that verse. Your love for me is so great, I never imagined God would see fit to give me someone so precious, so intentional. I promise to continue to show you all the 5 love languages, no matter if we\u2019re old and grey, it brings me countless joy getting to see your smile and hear the excitement in your voice. I will never grow tired or weary hearing about your day and the fun adventures you\u2019ve been on, and all the so cool projects and things you\u2019re getting to do. Zac, you are more than my answered prayer. I\u2019ve prayed and talked to God about you for years now, not knowing it was you I was talking to Him about. He knew, God knew what He was doing when He gave me you. You are the best role model as a Godly man and a Godly relationship, and what true love looks like. Everyone you meet when you\u2019re down here visiting will be astounded by your humility and humbleness. Your selflessness for me and for us. Reading this is just a reminder for why I chose you. I promise to love you with all that I have. Lord willing, I want to be the one to wake up by your side every morning, and come home to each night.

If nothing else, God gave us the Sun to rise in the sky without fail, and even that is enough reason to praise Him. \u201cSome trust in chariots, and some in horses: But we will remember the name of the LORD our God.

I\u2019m thankful for our sweet tooth chemistry and getting to eat your freshly baked cookies and cinnamon rolls. Thanks for making plans for us, but not being overbearing about them. It warmed my heart when you were willing to pass up on the opportunity to dress up together for Halloween just to appease the black cat in me. I can promise you that I will always be more than happy to make memories with you even if it means being a little uncomfortable.

Thanks for watching Spirited Away and Totaro with me, as strange as those movies are, I loved them and loved watching them with you. Thanks for getting us pumpkins so I could carve my first pumpkin, I hope our foxy isn\u2019t rotting away too quickly out there. Next Halloween I know we will carve/ paint even better pumpkins. Thanks for putting up that Christmas tree with me, it\u2019s an honor to have our first tree sit in your living room while we are apart. Thanks for drawing on my arms, your beautiful art marking my skin of our characters makes me so happy. I\u2019m still in awe at your character design of my boy. Thanks for paying for Wendy\u2019s, and shopping for food while thinking of me like the barbecue chicken pizza. Thanks for being open to watching that church message on salvation, even though it was a long one. It\u2019s an important matter to me. Thanks for the most comfortable bed in the world to sleep in, with the most cuddly partner I could dream of, for the hundreds of hugs and kisses shared between us and the parts we can\u2019t text about in here. Thanks for the bath and showers. Thanks for the trip to six flags, paying for my ticket and making for such a memorable night. Thanks for the ride back to the airport and paying for all the gas money. Thanks for all the small moments I couldn\u2019t capture in this text, they all matter to me dearly. Most importantly thanks for choosing to love me across the country, with such passion and thoughtfulness in every little thing. It\u2019s not easy being away from your lover, especially when we know we are going to have to do it for such a long time. I promise to choose to love you until the end, through everything. I am lucky to have you, I appreciate you more than I could ever express. I love you so so much, and every mile this plane travels away from you it burdens my heart. We are strong, and God is with us every step of the way. I can\u2019t wait for our future.",
